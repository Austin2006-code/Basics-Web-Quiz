The program displays six questions one at a time each with 4 choices to pick from.In each question there is a timer that runs for 10 seconds alerting the user when it is down to three seconds left.
To alert the user more there is a change in colour of the text and a flash effect as well. 
Once the time is up for a given question, it automatically moves to the next question marking that question as unanswered. 
To submit the answer, the user has to click on the submit answer button so as to activate the next question button
At the end of the quiz, the score, questions gotten right, questions unanswered, questions answered, and the time taken is displayed. 
An interactive feature is also displayed if the user answers all questions correctly.
It is also important to note that, the user can not submit no answer, an error message will appear prompting the user to pick an answer.
