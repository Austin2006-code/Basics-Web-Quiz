The basic web quiz is a simple program that runs on HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript language. 
The program displays six questions one at a time each with 4 choices to pick from. In each question there is a timer that runs for 10 seconds alerting the user when three seconds are remaining.
To alert the user more there is a change in colour of the text and a flash effect as well. 
Once the time is up for a given question, it automatically moves to the next question marking that question as unanswered. 
If no answer is picked wiith remaining time, an error message appears.
To submit the answer, the user has to click on the submit answer button so as to activate the next question button.
At the end of the quiz, the score, questions gotten right, questions unanswered, questions answered, and the time taken is displayed. 
An interactive feature is also displayed if the user answers all questions correctly.
